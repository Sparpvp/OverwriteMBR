# OverwriteMBR
Virus that overwrites the Master Boot Record with zeros on the disk which ran the file.  

# How do I compile it?
First, **be careful**: just _compile_.  
Make sure that you're **NOT** _compiling & running_ the file.  
  
Back to the point, it's hard, _if not impossible_, to compile a C++ source code using the **Win32API** on **Linux**.  
Then, _sadly_, **you'll need Windows** (should be supported either on i368 and amd64).
 
Compilers like __mingw, clang and msys2__ are going to work.
